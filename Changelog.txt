Credits:
Thanks goes to (alphabetically) David Hyde, Knightmare, Musashi, and Yamagi for their respective work on keeping Q2 both alive and also playable on modern architectures.


Known Bugs:
- The game will crash if a door tries to close on any monster either living or dead.  Be sure to gib any monsters that die in a doorway.
- After the cutscene, gun and crosshair visibility are not automatically restored.  To restore the Q2 defaults, you can set "cl_gun 2" and "crosshair 1" in the console.


Release 2 Notes:
- Saving now works on all maps!  The "target_effect" entity has been disabled because it was causing the game to crash when loading save files in maps that use it.  SPOILER: In SMD3 the hallway with the Brains near the start of the map consequently has an invisible trap now.  Be sure to locate the switch to disable the "invisible steam" before passing down the hallway.

Release 2 Change Log:
g_func_decs.h
Missing function declaration added

g_target.c
Disabled the SP_target_effect entity and all related functions


Release 1 Notes:
- No attempt has been made to clean up the original Lazarus_SMD code beyond simply getting it compiling with GCC and as operational in-game as I could.
- Music and footstep noises are unavailable on non-Windows platforms due to FMOD being Windows-only.
- Fog is disabled on all platforms.  Re-enabling it on Windows would require removing all code related to the 3dfxgl implementation of GLide (which neither GCC or YamagiQ2 supports).
- On Windows the old Lazarus save-file system is used w/o Knightmare's enhancements.  This is because the list of game functions is slightly different when compiled on Windows, owing to the differences in Sound listed above.
